# CrestronBoseESPModules
Dedicated to improving and distributing better Crestron modules for controlling Bose ESP devices

The first major change since the orginal code is the addition of the Simpl+ module "ESP Serial Gather".  This should be connected to the rx$ of your ESP (either serial or ethernet).
